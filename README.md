        Yet another <a href="https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code">Dracula Theme</a> fork for <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a>, but slightly better!

Don't get me wrong: Dracula is an awesome theme, but some of the decisions that were made for implementing it on VS Code don't please me, to be honest. So I decided to fork it and try to bring the same experience that [OneDark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) brings with its uniform, subtle look and feel.

## Install

All instructions can be found at [INSTALL](./INSTALL), but you could just open the **Extensions** tab on VS Code and search for "Dracula Refined" (without quotes).
